# 1. Introduction to KTON

**KTON** is a next-generation liquid staking protocol purpose-built for **The Open Network (TON)**.  Incubated by **TONX Studio** and backed by the TonCore (NEWTON) validator research team, KTON allows anyone to stake TON coins, receive a transferable yield-bearing token (the *KTON jetton*), and use that token across the growing TON DeFi landscape — all without forfeiting staking rewards.

## 1.1 Origin & Vision

* 2021 — First TON validators are launched by the NEWTON team, laying the groundwork for institutional staking services.
* 2022 — The **TonStake** project pioneers public validator pools, onboarding thousands of early miners.
* 2025 — **KTON V2** introduces dynamic liquidity management, MEV-optimised yields, and advanced governance.

Our long-term vision is to make TON staking as liquid and ubiquitous as ETH staking, accelerating DeFi adoption and opening the door to sophisticated capital markets on Telegram's native blockchain.

## 1.2 What Problems Does KTON Solve?

| Challenge | Traditional TON Staking | KTON Solution |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Illiquidity | Funds are locked for the entire validator cycle. | Stakers receive **$KTON** jettons that can be traded, lent or used as collateral. |
| High Entry Barrier | Validator seats require 10 000+ TON. | Pooling enables anyone to stake from **1 TON**. |
| Operational Overhead | Running a validator demands 24/7 uptime & DevOps expertise. | Professional node operators do the heavy lifting while users share rewards. |
| Inflexible Rewards | Static APY, no optimisation for MEV. | *Planned* dynamic validator rotation and MEV capture aiming for **up to 8 %** sustainable APY. |
| Lack of DeFi Composability | Staked TON is isolated from the ecosystem. | $KTON integrates with DEXs, lending and yield protocols across TON. |

## 1.3 Key Highlights

* **Institutional-grade security**: audited contracts, role-based access control, and time-delayed upgrades.
* **Zero lock-up**: deposit or redeem at any time; instant withdrawal via swap pools.
* **Telegram-native UX**: Mini Apps and bot integrations tap into Telegram's 1 B user base.
* **Official Telegram Bot**: access KTON directly via our Telegram Mini App at <https://t.me/ktonio_bot>.
* **DeFi-ready from day one**: supported by DEXs such as STON.fi & DeDust, and visible on DefiLlama.
* **Transparent on-chain accounting**: real-time pool metrics via TonViewer & TONScan.
