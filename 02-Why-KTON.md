# 2. Why KTON?

KTON stands out among liquid staking solutions on TON by combining **institutional-grade security**, **DeFi composability**, and a **Telegram-native user experience**.

## 2.1 Value Proposition

1. **TON Native First-Mover** — The first public liquid staking protocol on TON, live since 2022.
2. **Radical Transparency** — 100 % open-source code; every commit is verifiable on GitHub.
3. **Security-Certified** — Independently audited (TonBit) and continuously reviewed by multiple internal teams.
4. **24 / 7 Validator Monitoring** — Real-time oversight by TONX for instant incident response and maximum uptime.
5. **Effortless Auto-Compounding** — Rewards are auto-reinvested; no manual claiming required.
6. **MEV-Enhanced Yield** — Future upgrades will capture network MEV to boost staking returns.
7. **Capital Efficiency Perfected** — Smart liquidity routing keeps every TON working at peak efficiency.

## 2.2 Market Opportunity

* **TON Liquid Staking TVL** remains a small fraction of total TON supply (well below Ethereum's staking ratio).
* With billions of TON tokens in circulation, even a small percentage shift into liquid staking represents a significant addressable market.
* The **Telegram ecosystem** provides a ready-made funnel of 950 M users, vastly larger than any single blockchain community today.

KTON is positioned to capture this growth by offering superior UX, robust security, and deep integrations with leading DeFi protocols.
